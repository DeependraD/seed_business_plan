- A corporation's share capital or capital stock (in US English) is the portion of a corporation's equity that has been obtained by the issue of shares in the corporation to a shareholder, usually for cash. "Share capital" may also denote the number and types of shares that compose a corporation's share structure.

In a strict accounting sense, share capital is the nominal value of issued shares (that is, the sum of their par values, as indicated on share certificates). If the allocation price of shares is greater than their par value, as in a rights issue, the shares are said to be sold at a premium (variously called share premium, additional paid-in capital or paid-in capital in excess of par). Commonly, the share capital is the total of the aforementioned nominal share capital and the premium share capital. Conversely, when shares are issued below par, they are said to be issued at a discount or part-paid.

- Reserves and Surplus: These are part of the Ownerâ€™s Equity. 
- Equity is the cumulative investment of the owner in his business on the Balance Sheet date. In other words, it is the residual interest of the owner in his business. It is called so because it is the amount that will be left with the owner after assets have been utilized to pay off all the liabilities. You may also say that this is the amount that the business owes to its owner. Business and its owner are two separate entities in the accounting practice as per the Separate Entity Concept (Thus, assets are kept in a separate side to liabilities and owner's equity).
